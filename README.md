# collection of ableton related functions. For me.

- ** backup-Library **  ($source, $target, $logfile) makes a differential backuop to my NFS attached Nas, because the NAS will do offline backups.
- get-SetsParameters ($Source) parses a path, looks for Ableton Live Sets. The Sets are parsed an some metadata are written to a csv file.

If you find usable code, use it.
